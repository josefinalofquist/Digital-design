    <h1>What I Learned After Getting a New Puppy </h1>

    <p>
    I thought I knew exactly what I was getting into when we brought home our new puppy. I have been around dogs my entire life,
    and we raised 3 puppies in my family while I was  growing up. I’ve also volunteered in multiple shelters and fostered dogs here and there.

     When taking our puppy out and about, strangers would see us with the happily-clumsy mess of fur and ask,
    “Is this your first puppy?"

    I had a Shaan growing up, too. His name was Volk (the Russian word for wolf), a black-and-tan German shepherd with sparkling black eyes.
    I remember nights of camping out in the backyard and waking up to sounds of him treading in circles around our tent, ever the loyal watchman.

     <h2>You will spend more money than you planned </h2>
     <p>
    Before we got our puppy, I knew having a dog was expensive, but I told myself we’d do things on the cheap side:
    get the bare minimum of toys, no going to classes, find the cheapest vet we can get away with and still have a healthy dog.
     </p>

     <p>
        After Bringing the dog home, however, you start to see the importance of mental occupation.
        <em>Would you rather your dog chew on your coffee table, your hand, or a chew toy?</em>

      <h2>Prioritize socialization and handling</h2>
      <p>
        Puppies have a socialization window that ends at 14 weeks of age; by that time you should have introduced your puppy to anything you want them to be able to encounter with confidence in life, the most important being people.
