        <h2>Historik</h2>
        <p>
        The Golden Retriever originates from the border regions between England and Scotland and was bred
        during the latter part of the 1800s. Hunters needed a retriever dog that could search for and bring
        back game birds that had been shot. The dog needed to be able to work both on land and in water,
        remain calm and obedient during hunting, and cooperate well with its handler and other dogs.
