    <h2>Historik</h2>
    <p>
    The Dachshund is one of the oldest hunting dog breeds and originates from Germany. 
    It was primarily bred for hunting badgers and foxes in their dens, thanks to its short legs 
    and elongated body. Today the breed is popular both as a hunting dog and as a companion dog. 
    It comes in several sizes and coat varieties, but all share the same characteristic body shape.
