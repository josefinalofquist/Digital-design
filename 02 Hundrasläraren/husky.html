        <h2>Historik</h2>
        <p>
        The nomadic people of northern Siberia were completely dependent on this type of dog for survival.
        Its original function was to pull sleds and transport goods over long distances at moderate speed.
        Later the breed began to be used in sled dog races when its speed and endurance were discovered.
